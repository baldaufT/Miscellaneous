# Roulette

This program implements a roulette game and a Player, who plays the game. In the analysis program we analyse the strategy "double-if-loss". For sure, statistically it won't work in the long run, but quite often it could work out (you always need a bit of luck). Moreover, we can add a number, which indicates how long (red or black in a row) we wait until we start the first investment (could be solved otherwise with more money / investedCapital).

The files are the resulted values out of the analysis... if you want to do further analysis based on the calculated values (for waiting 5 times).
